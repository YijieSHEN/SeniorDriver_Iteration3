    <h4 class="text-center">Causes & Safety Tips</h4>
    <p>As human age they suffer a decline in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive</a> capabilities directly effecting driving abilities. Although by adopting safe driving practices and mitigating risk factors it is very much possible to keep driving deep into our old years. The important thing is to lookout for signs which indicate that age is interfering with ones driving abilities and adjust accordingly. This page will provide a comprehensive coverage on the likely causes of elderly driver accidents and achievable ways of increasing their safety.

    <h4 class="text-center">Effects of aging on driving</h4>
    <p>There is no particular age when someone should stop driving and it is important to realise that all old drivers are not unsafe. Although research conducted on past crash data indicates that fatal crash rates rises for drivers aged 70 or older. Ageing effects various aspects of visual attention, visual impairment, impaired hearing, reduced executive functions as well as reductions in strength, coordination and flexibility. All of which tends to effect driving adversely as show below:
    </p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li><h5>Visual attention:</h5>Visual attention: Ageing affects visual attention including selective attention, divided attention, sustained attention and switching attention. Driving in traffic requires the ability to attend to relevant information and to ignore irrelevant information in often complex visual scenes with potential hazards occurring in any part of the visual field. Therefore, the speed at which visual information is processed is an important factor for successfully negotiating difficult or dangerous traffic situations. Problems include keeping track of so many road signs, signals, and markings, as well as all the other traffic and pedestrians.
          </li>
          <li><h5>Executive Function:</h5>Another aspect of cognition relevant to driving that declines in normal aging is executive function. Executive function is necessary for integrating information and planning a response, and thus is highly relevant to competent driving. Given that the types of crashes in which older adults are involved often occur in complex traffic situations such as intersections, it is reasonable to hypothesize that difficulties are occurring at the level of executive function (i.e., the planning and decision making part of the driving task).Problems include spotting vehicles emerging from side streets and driveways, or to realize that the vehicle ahead of you has slowed or stopped.
          </li>
          <li><h5>Visual Impairment:</h5>Visual impairment becomes significantly more common with increasing age, through both the normal aging process and the increased prevalence of eye disease. These changes lead to reductions in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and increased glare sensitivity observed in older populations. Thus it is not surprising that age-related changes in visual function is a major risk factors for crashes among older adults as vision is considered the major sensory input for driving.
          </li>
          <li><h5>Physical abilities: </h5>Physical frailty and medical conditions may also put older adults at risk of unsafe driving and increase the likelihood of injury when involved in accidents. Problems include:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Pain or stiffness in your neck can make it harder to look over your shoulder to change lanes or look left and right at intersections to check for other traffic or pedestrians.</li>
            <li>Leg pain can make it difficult to move your foot from the gas to the brake pedal.</li>
            <li>Diminished arm strength can make it hard to turn the steering wheel quickly and effectively.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="text-center">Safety Tips</h4>
    <p>As mentioned previously aging does not necessarily mean one has to give up driving. There are many things that can be done to ensure safe driving for elders as mentioned below:

    <h5>Eyes checked:</h5>One needs to have their eyes checked regularly, at least once annually upon reaching a certain age. Other factors that can help with visual aid include keeping the windshield, mirrors and headlights clean and turn up the brightness of the instruments in the dashboard. Questions to ask yourself to detect eye problems are can you easily see traffic lights and street signs? Or do you find yourself driving closer and closer to them, slowing by just to see the lights or signs? Can you react appropriately to drivers coming from behind or the side?
    <h5>Hearing checked: </h5>Have ones hearing checked on a regular basis if experiencing problems. If hearing aids are prescribed make sure they are worn at all times during driving. Can you hear emergency sirens, or if someone is accelerating next to you, or the honking of a horn?
    <h5>Communicate effective with doctor:</h5>It is important to communicate with your doctor on the medicines you are given and how they might affect your driving. Obey what is instructed by your doctor. For example certain medicines may cause drowsiness and does not permit you to drive for a certain period of time after consumption.
    <h5>Choosing the right car:</h5>Guide older drivers to purchase new or used vehicles with a high ANCAP rating to promote safety features like front, side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control and side impact protection. To check for car safety ratings via our website <a href="">CLICK HERE(Take to our car safety page)</a>.
    <h5>Avoid Distractions:</h5>In this age of smartphones, GPS devices and music players it is very easy to get distracted. Although distraction during driving is unwelcome for any age group, it can prove particularly fatal for elderly drivers. Avoid distractions such as talking on the phone while driving or trying to puzzle out a map, even if it’s a GPS on the car; pull over instead.
    <h5>Knowing Limitations:</h5>For instance, you may decide to drive only during daylight hours if you have trouble seeing well in reduced light. If fast-moving traffic bothers you, consider staying off freeways, highways, and find street routes instead. You may also decide to avoid driving in bad weather (rain, thunderstorms, snow, hail, ice). If you are going to a place that is unfamiliar to you, it is a good idea to plan your route before you leave so that you feel more confident and avoid getting lost.
    <h5>Voice Concerns:</h5><p>If as a relative or friend of the elderly driver you think are having issues with driving safety talk to them immediately. They can be persuaded to do the following:</p>
